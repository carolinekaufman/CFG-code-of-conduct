## The Tufts Code for Good Program Code of Conduct

Forked from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/)

The Code of Conduct lays out the conduct expectations of the Code for Good community. This document is a work in progress, and we'd like all CFG participants, alumni and students alike, to have a voice. If you'd like to add or change something in the code of conduct, simply clone the repository, make your changes, and open a pull request, so that your contribution can be reviewed by other members of the community.
